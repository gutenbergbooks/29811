<h2>MORE ABOUT THE MITTENS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mittens were coming bravely on.
Some evenings, Aunt Fanny could not
send a story; and then the little mother
read an entertaining book, or chatted
pleasantly with her children.</p>

<p>There had been twelve pairs finished,
during the reading of the third book, and
several more were on the way. George
had written the most delightful letters,
each of which was read to his eagerly-listening
sisters and brothers several times,
for they were never tired of hearing about
life in camp.</p>

<p>This evening, the mother drew another
letter, received that day, out of her pocket.
The very sight of the envelope, with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
precious flag in the corner, caused their
eyes to sparkle, and their fingers to fly at
their patriotic and loving work.</p>

<p>"Attention!" said the mother in a
severe, military tone. Everybody burst
out laughing, choked it off, immediately
straightened themselves up as stiff as ramrods,
and she began:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mother, Captain, and all the
beloved squad</span>:&mdash;Our camp is splendid!
We call it Camp Ellsworth. It covers
the westward slope of a beautiful hill.
The air is pure and fresh, and our streets
(for we have real ones) are kept as clean
as a pin. Not an end of a cigar, or an
inch of potato peeling, dare to show themselves.
Directly back of the camp strong
earthworks have been thrown up, with
rifle pits in front; and these are manned
by four artillery companies from New
York. Our commissary is a very good fellow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
but I wish he would buy pork with
less fat. I am like the boy in school, who
wrote home to his mother, his face all
puckered up with disgust: "They make
us eat p-h-a-t!!" When I swizzle it (or
whatever you call that kind of cooking) in
a pan over the fire, there is nothing left
of a large slice, but a little shrivelled
brown bit, swimming in about half a pint
of melted lard, not quarter enough to satisfy
a great robin redbreast like me; but
I make the most of it, by pointing my
bread for some time at it, and then eating
a lot of bread before I begin at the pork.
The pointing, you see, gives the bread a
flavor."</p></div>

<p>The children screamed with laughter
at this, and wanted to have some salt pork
cooked immediately to try the "pointing"
flavor. Their mother promised to have
some for breakfast, and went on reading:</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"We are very busy at drills. I give the
boys plenty of field exercise, quick step,
skirmishes, double quick, and all manner
of man&oelig;uvres. After drill, we sing songs,
tell jokes, and <i>play</i> jokes upon each other,
but we don't forget, in doing this, that we
are <i>gentlemen</i>.</p>

<p>"Oh dear mother, I am crazy to be in
action! I am afraid, if we don't have a
battle soon, I shall get motheaten. Our
General is a glorious fellow, and is just
as anxious as we are to have it over;
peace will come all the sooner. Hollo!
Here comes "Tapp," and I must blow out
my half inch of tallow candle, and go to
bed.</p>

<p>"Good-by, all my dear ones. Love
and pray for your affectionate son and
brother,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">George</span>."<br />
</div></div>

<p>"Ah!" sighed the children, as the
mother folded up the letter. Then they
were silent, thinking of the dear brother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
who wanted so much to be in the dreadful
battle; and the little mother was
looking very mournful when there came
a ring at the bell.</p>

<p>The servant handed in a package, which
proved to be a story from "Aunt Fanny."
It came very fortunately; and the mittens
grew fast, as the little mother read the
interesting history of&mdash;</p>

<h2>THE PARTY LILLIE GAVE FOR<br />
MISS FLORENCE.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap"><ins title="Transcriber's Note: This word not smallcapped in the original">Oh</ins></span>, mamma, please <i>do</i> buy me a new
doll," said Lillie, one day in June.</p>

<p>"Why, how you talk!" answered her
mother. "What has become of your large
family?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma! Minnie, the china doll,
has only one leg, and my three wax dolls
are no better. Fanny has only one arm;
both Julia's eyes are out; and the kitten
scratched off Maria's wig the other day,
and she has the most dreadful-looking,
bald pate you ever saw! Instead of its
being made of nice white wax, it is nothing
but old brown paper! I think it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
very mean not to make dolls' bald heads
like other people's! Then I could have
dressed Maria up in pantaloons, and made
a grandfather of her. But now she is fit
for nothing but to be put in a cornfield
to scare away the crows."</p>

<p>Lillie's mother laughed, and kissed her
lovely daughter, who had not met with
any of the terrible misfortunes that had
befallen her wax and china family. <i>She</i>
had both her round and chubby white
arms; and two pretty and active legs, that
made themselves very useful in skipping
and jumping from morning till night; and
just the prettiest golden brown wig you
ever saw. It was fastened on so tight,
that the kitten, with all her scratchings,
could never twitch it off; in fact, every
single hair was fastened by a root in her
dear little head, and fell in soft, natural
curls over her dimpled cheeks.</p>

<p>That very afternoon, her mother went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
out shopping; and looking in at a toy
shop window, she saw a splendid wax
doll nearly three feet long. It was dressed
up in all manner of furbelows, but the
dress did not look half so fresh and lovely
as the doll. The arms and hands were
all wax, round, pinky-white, and beautifully
shaped, with two cunning dimples
in the elbows, and four little dimples in
the back of each hand. She had dark
curling hair, large blue eyes, and very
small feet.</p>

<p>"Well," said the loving mother to herself,
"I really <i>must</i> try to get this splendid
doll for my darling Lillie." Her own
gentle blue eyes quite sparkled at the
thought of the happiness such a present
would bring with it. So she walked
quickly in, and asked the price.</p>

<p>Oh dear! It was twenty dollars!</p>

<p>This was more than the mother thought
right to give for the doll; and she told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the man so, very politely. He was a very
wise man, and what is more and better,
kept a toy shop, because he loved children
dearly; so he put his head on one side,
and thought; then he looked out of the
corner of his eye at the lady, and saw what
a pleasant, sweet expression was on her
face; then he thought again&mdash;this time,
how disappointed the sweet little girl at
home would be, if she knew her mother
was out looking for a doll for her, and
came home without one; and then he
said, "What do you think the doll is
worth?"</p>

<p>Lillie's mother told him what she considered
a fair price, and the darling, good
toyman spoke up as quick as a flash,
"You shall have it, ma'am! Here, John,
put this doll in paper, and take it to 'No.
13 Clinton Place.'"</p>

<span class="caption">Helen&#39;s Return Home.</span>
</div>

<p>Lillie's sister Helen was going to spend
the summer with her dear grandmamma in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Middletown. A splendid idea came into the
kind mother's head. Taking Helen into a
room alone, she said, "My dear, you will
want some sewing to do, while you are
away; suppose you take the beautiful
doll and make up several suits of clothes
for her, just as neatly as possible. I am
sure your grandmamma will help you;
and when you return, we will have a delightful
surprise for Lillie."
The darling, good sister, was just as
pleased as possible with this plan: indeed,
she had not got past liking to play with
dolls herself; and she was very different
from some elder sisters, who take an
unamiable pleasure in teasing the younger
ones, instead of joining in their plays,
and doing everything to add to their
happiness. So the doll and all sorts
of pretty muslins and silks, and materials
for under garments, were mysteriously
packed away in Helen's trunk, and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
went off to her grandmother's pleasant
country house, without Lillie's having the
slightest suspicion of what she was going
to do. She was very busy all summer
making the clothes, with her grandmamma's
help. Many of the pleasant mornings
she sat on the steps of the door, listening
to the singing of the birds as she sewed.</p>


<p>And now this is a very good place to
tell you about Lillie and her sisters; for
she had three dear sisters&mdash;Helen, Mary,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and sweet little Maggie; and no brother
at all. The only one she ever had, went
to live with Jesus in heaven, after staying
only fifteen months here in this world.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 232px;">
<img src="images/i004.jpg" width="232" height="300" alt="Sitting" title="Sitting" />
</div>

<p>You know already what a kind mother
the children had; and I am very certain
their papa loved them just as much.
When he is with them, his dark, bright,
and piercing eyes droop and soften into
an expression of so much affection, that
one day, when I was visiting at his house,
I caught myself repeating the words of a
perfect little poem, which seemed to have
been written expressly for him. It is so
beautiful, and describes the children so
well, with the change of one or two words,
that I have ventured to copy it here for
you. It was written by Gerald Massey.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"There be four maidens; four loving maidens;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Four bonny maidens, mine;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Four precious jewels are set in Life's crown,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">On prayer-lifted brows to shine.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Eight starry eyes, all love-luminous,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Look out of our heaven so tender;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Since the honeymoon glowing and glorious</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Arose in its ripening splendor.</span><br />
<br />
"There's Lillie bell, the duchess of wonderland,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With her dance of life, dimples and curls;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Whose bud of a mouth into sweet kisses bursts,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A-smile with the little white pearls:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And Mary our rosily-goldening peach,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And Helen&mdash;mother's own darling,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And Maggie, the baby of all."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The summer was passed by our dear
little Lillie in playing and frolicking, and
sometimes tearing her frocks; which last,
her mother minded not the least bit, as
long as it was an accident. I don't, either.
Children had better tear their frocks a
little, jumping, climbing over fences, and
getting fat and healthy, than to sit in
the house, looking pale and miserable.
My Alice often comes in, a perfect object
to behold! I sometimes wonder the ragman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
who drives the old cart with a
row of jingling bells strung over the top,
don't mistake her for a bundle of rags
gone out for a walk. I don't feel <i>worried</i>
about it; for if he <i>should</i> happen to make
this mistake, and pop her in his cart some
day, Alice would make one of her celebrated
Indian "yoops," as she calls it, and
I rather think he would pop her out,
quicker than she went in.</p>

<p>When September had come, Helen
returned home; and soon after, the mother
said, "Lillie, there is a young lady in town,
who wishes to make your acquaintance.
She is quite grand and fashionable in her
ideas, so we must make a little flourish for
her. What do you think of having a
party to receive her?"</p>

<p>"A party!" screamed Lillie, clapping
her hands with delight; "I would like
that <i>very</i> much; and oh! please have
candy, and oranges, and oh! mottoes&mdash;lots<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of snapping mottoes for the party!
That would be most delightful! And
please ask Nattie, and Kittie, and Lina,
and Emily, and oh! everybody."</p>

<p>"You must ask them yourself. See,
here is a quantity of pretty buff and pink
note paper, and here is a nice new pen:
sit down and write your invitations."</p>

<p>This was a tremendous business! and
Lillie, spreading herself in great grandeur,
with her head on one side, took the pen
and wrote very nicely, <i>for her</i>, all the
notes, in this way:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Miss Lillie B&mdash;&mdash; wishes you To
Come to A party to-morrow to Meet A
young Lady. Her name Is&mdash;i Don't
Know Yet. Please Come At Seven-o-Clock.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Lillie.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>Then she doubled them up into little
squares, and put them into the envelopes;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and Margery, the maid, who loved Lillie
dearly, and <i>would</i> have rode off with the
notes on a broomstick to Jerusalem, if her
little lady had wanted her to&mdash;trotted
about all the morning, leaving them at
the children's houses, telling the waiters
who answered the doors, on no account to
stop a single moment, but rush right up
stairs with them, as they were of the
greatest importance.</p>

<p>The next morning, Lillie got all the
answers. I should think there were about
twenty little notes, all directed to her.
Was ever anything known to equal it?
A lady getting so many letters at once!
It was almost too much happiness. They
did not all come at once, which was
very lucky; for I do believe Lillie would
have gone crazy with delight. She opened
the first with trembling eagerness,
dancing up and down the whole time,
and read these enchanting words:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">"dear lillie&mdash;<br />

<p>"i will come. i shall wear my best
frock&mdash;what a funny name the young lady
has. miss don't know yet</p>

<div class='sig'>"good bye. yours, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Nattie</span>."<br />
</div></div>

<p>"Oh, mamma," she cried, laughing,
"Nattie thinks the young lady's name is
'Miss Don't Know Yet!' How funny!
But really, what is her name, mamma?"</p>

<p>"She will tell you that herself, when
she comes. She wants to surprise you."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Lillie; and just then another
note was handed to her, and she
read this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Lillie</span>:&mdash;Mamma is writing
this note for me, and she says&mdash;I accept
your invitation with much pleasure. So I
do, certainly. What delightful fun it is
to go to a party! I wish you would have
one every week.</p>

<div class='sig'>"Your loving friend, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Kitty</span>."<br />
</div></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, mamma"&mdash;Lillie was just going
to ask her mother to let her have a party
every week&mdash;when Maggie brought another
note. This was from a young gentleman,
and was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Master Russell is coming to Your
Party; and I will Eat all the plum Cake,
and bring A pack of Crackers In my pocket&mdash;to
fire off in honor Of Miss Doughnut.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"Yours affectionately,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Sam Russell</span>."<br />
</div></div>

<p>Lillie thought this was a splendid idea!
It would be such an honor to the young
lady to receive her with popping a pack
of crackers at her, just as they fire off cannon
at the President when he comes to
town.</p>

<p>"Oh, how enchanting it is!" she cried,
and she jumped up on a chair and jumped
down again three times running, she was
so happy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Everybody was coming, and all wrote
notes very like those I have told you.
The weather was beautiful, and, for a wonder,
everything went just right.</p>

<p>Long before seven o'clock, Lillie was
dressed and in the parlor waiting for her
little friends. She got very impatient,
and was just beginning to think they
never meant to come; or had all been
naughty, and were sent to bed instead of
going to a party, when the door bell rang&mdash;then
again&mdash;then again&mdash;and a moment
after a little troop of laughing, lovely
children skipped into the room, all talking
together, and all running to kiss Lillie at
once; so that not a quarter of them could
find a place on her sweet, happy face, and
had to wait for their turn.</p>

<p>Then some nice little boys came in,
with their faces scrubbed so clean they
fairly shone, and their hair parted down
the middle behind so very even that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
seam looked like a streak of white chalk.
They went up to Lillie very bashfully, and
shook hands; and then all got together in
a corner, because you see they were afraid
of the girls, and imagined that they were
making fun of them.</p>

<p>But after a little while this fear seemed
to fly up the chimney, for boys and girls
were playing "turn the platter," and "hunt
the ring," and the larger ones were dancing;
and everybody was having the most
delightful time possible.</p>

<p>Dear little rosebud Maggie was the
happiest of any, for she was to sit up
until every scrap of the party was over;
so everybody kissed her, and played with
her, and showed her how to turn the
platter, and she skipped and danced; and
that dear little chuckling, singing laugh
of hers was heard in every corner of the
room. The fact is, Little Maggie is one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of my particular darlings. Don't tell anybody.</p>

<p>But where was the young lady all this
time?</p>

<p>Lillie had scarcely thought of her, she
was so happy with the dear little friends
she knew and loved. Of course a stranger
could not expect to have the same place
in her loving heart, especially as she had
not yet had even the first peep at her.</p>

<p>Her sister Mary had gone out of the
room a little while before, and Lillie was
wondering why she did not return, when
there came a tremendous ringing at the
bell.</p>

<p>"She's coming!" whispered Lillie to
herself, and her heart beat fast as the door
opened; and there marched gravely in&mdash;not
a young lady&mdash;but a little old gentleman,
whose hair was perfectly white, though he
seemed to have a great deal of it, for his
head was about the size of a half peck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
measure. He wore a very long-tailed coat,
buttoned up very tight; his pantaloons
only reached down to his knees; but to
make up for that his stockings came up to
meet them, and were fastened with perfectly
beautiful garters, with a big silver
buckle shining in the very middle; shoes,
also flourishing large silver buckles, adorned
his feet. So you see he was quite an
old dandy.</p>

<p>Leaning on his arm was a little old
lady. Her hair was also as white as
snow; and she too had so much, and it
was so fuzzy, that it looked for all the
world like a pound of cotton batting.
She was dressed in the most gorgeous
array, perfectly elegant to behold! white
satin, and flowers, and furbelows; and was
so very dignified and stiff in her manners
that Lillie thought she must have fallen
into a kettle of starch.</p>

<p>Another tremendous ring at the bell!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and the servant who answered it came
into the parlor and said the little old gentleman
and lady were wanted out in the
hall immediately.</p>

<p>They made each a low bow and
marched out of the room, while the children's
bright eyes grew larger and larger,
and they asked each other, with a little
hop and skip apiece, what in the world
was coming next.</p>

<p>As to Lillie, the lovely pink roses deepened
on her cheeks; her eyes shone like
diamonds, and two dimples kept playing
hide and seek with the smiles that were
chasing them every instant.</p>

<p>It was a breathless moment! All
were waiting&mdash;their eyes fastened on the
door. The knob turned&mdash;it slowly opened&mdash;and
in marched the little old lady and
gentleman, holding between them by the
hands, the most perfectly beautiful young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
lady that was ever seen in the whole
world!!</p>

<p>She had on a white tarleton dress, with
two skirts trimmed with cherry-colored
blond lace. The waist was gathered in at
the belt, and finished round the neck with
a beautiful lace berthe. She wore a sash
of cherry-colored satin ribbon, and in her
belt was an elegant chatelaine, from which
hung a tiny gold watch exactly the size of
a five cent piece. A necklace was round
her neck, and a wreath of flowers upon
her head. She had fine open-worked
stockings and morocco shoes. In her right
hand was the cunningest little fan that
ever was seen! and altogether she was
quite the belle of the evening.</p>

<p>All the children drew a long breath!
and gazed with admiration as the three
strangers marched all round the room.
Then they stopped in the very middle,
and Lillie's mother, stepping up beside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
them, gracefully waved her hand and
said:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, let me present
to you Mr. and Mrs. Grey, and Miss
Florence Grey."</p>

<p>The little old gentleman put his hand
on his heart, and made such a low bow to
the company that they saw the back of his
bushy white head, and his long coat tails
stuck out behind like a pennon in a high
breeze; and the little old lady put her
hand on <i>her</i> heart, and dropped such a
low courtesy that the children thought she
meant to sit down on the carpet; but
Miss Florence looked straight before her,
and never took the slightest notice of anybody.</p>

<p>Just then a queer little laugh was
heard; a kind of a smothered, bursting
laugh. The children stared! and there
was the little old gentleman stuffing his
pocket handkerchief into his mouth, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
perfectly shaking with laughter!! What
conduct in an aged person!! But worse
was coming! The little old lady began to
laugh; then she screamed with laughter,
and shook so that a most dreadful thing
happened! She laughed all the hair off
her head! It first tumbled over sideways,
and then fell on the carpet all in a
bunch!</p>

<p>"Sister Mary!! sister Mary!!" cried
Lillie, running up to the little old lady,
who, strange to tell! had another crop of
beautiful golden brown hair under the
other, smoothed down very close to her
head.</p>

<p>"Why, it's a wig!" screamed the children,
all laughing and running up. Was
there ever anything so funny: "It's nothing
but Miss Mary in a wig."</p>

<p>At this very moment Master Sam Russell
stepped slyly behind the little old
gentleman, and twitched at his bushy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
white hair. It all came off in his hand
amid roars of laughter; and underneath
was the brown head of Harry, one of the
greatest fellows for fun you ever saw, and
a dear cousin of Lillie's.</p>

<p>But Miss Florence stared at it all with
a simpering smile on her face; till Lillie,
looking close at her, caught her up in
her arms, and hugging her to her breast
screamed joyfully out&mdash;"It's a new doll!
a new doll!! Miss Florence is a new
doll!!" and began running round the
whole length of the two rooms, all the
children scampering after her, laughing
and shouting, till they threw themselves
down on the sofas and chairs, perfectly
breathless.</p>

<p>Yes, Miss Florence was a splendid
wax doll; and the children gathered
round Lillie, after just one second of rest,
for they could not possibly be expected
to sit still longer than that; and admired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and kissed the stranger; and "Oh, what
a darling! what lovely eyes! what pretty
boots! how big she is! and so on," was
heard on all sides.</p>

<p>A tremendous ring at the bell!
Why! were wonders never to cease? In
came Margery saying there was a trunk
in the hall left by the expressman, who
said Miss Florence Grey must pay him
twenty-five cents, and he would not stir a
step till she did.</p>

<p>Here was a difficulty! Lillie's money
never had a chance to burn a hole in <i>her</i>
pocket, because she spent it the very
moment her mamma or papa gave her
any; and she did not know where
twenty-five cents were to come from.</p>

<p>"Suppose you feel in Miss Florence's
pocket," said her mother.</p>

<p>"Ah! let's see!" cried Lillie; so she
poked two of her little fingers in the
pocket, and sure <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'enugh'">enough</ins>! there was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
bright, new quarter of a dollar. She
rushed out and gave it to the expressman,
who hardly waited to say, "thank you,"
but was on his wagon with a bound, and
round the corner like a flash of lightning.</p>

<p>Well, there in the hall was a beautiful
new trunk! two of the boys brought it in
very politely. But it was locked. What
was to be done now?</p>

<p>"Feel in Miss Florence's pocket," advised
the good mother again.</p>

<p>Lillie poked in two little fingers as
before, and said that way down in the
bottom there was certainly something.
She caught it at last, and when it was
fished out, it proved to be a small key.</p>

<p>All the children crowded round as the
trunk was unlocked; and then you would
have given a hundred dollars, only to see
their faces, and hear them clap their
hands, and exclaim with delight as dress
after dress, and petticoats all tucked up,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
pantalettes with the most beautiful embroidery
round the legs, and a round
straw hat, and two French bonnets, and
all sorts of things; and everything else
besides, was taken out. Oh, it was almost
too good to believe!</p>

<p>Down sat the darlings on the carpet,
and spread all the articles out. The boys
looking on very much pleased.</p>

<p>"Let's try all the dresses on," said one
of the little girls.</p>

<p>No sooner said, than done! and before
Miss Florence could say "Jack Robinson,"
off came the dress she was wearing.</p>

<p>Did you ever! To be trying on a
lady's dress at a party!! Who ever
heard of such a thing? I never did! But
the best of it was, that Miss Florence did
not seem to care a button; she smiled and
simpered, and allowed herself to be tumbled
over on her nose, and never squealed
an atom when pins were run into her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
back. But no doubt she came to the
conclusion that it was the custom of the
country. At any rate, she could not help
loving Lillie; and for my part, I don't
know who could.</p>

<p>In the middle of the dressing, supper
was announced! which was joyful news,
as all the romping and playing had made
the children as hungry as hunters; and, at
the sight of a great table perfectly loaded
down with cakes, oranges, and mottoes,
instead of gravely marching in, looking as
solemn as owls&mdash;as grown people do&mdash;they
skipped and danced with delight:
and such a little, laughing, joyous party
was worth all the grum old grown-up balls
from now to never. I wish all the children
would invite me to their parties; I think
it is <i>such</i> fun! The sight of so many
happy little faces takes nearly all the sad
look out of my face, and quite all the sad
thoughts out of my heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>They all ate just as much as they
wanted of the nice things, and the little
boys pulled the snapping mottoes with the
girls; and very politely gave the motto
papers, all crammed full of "love and
dove," and "bliss and kiss," to those they
liked best.</p>

<p>Then they played games and danced,
and were so <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'perfecty'">perfectly</ins> happy, that when
the servants came to take them home,
they one and all declared that they would
not go, as their mammas had said they
might stay till ten o'clock; when, would
you believe it? Lillie's mother said it was
ten minutes after ten then!</p>

<p>Where in the world had all the time
gone to, this evening? Just the very
evening, of all others, when they wanted
it to last three times longer than usual!
It really was too bad; and was very unkind
in the hands of the clock to scrabble
over such delightful hours so fast. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
there was no help for it now; and they
put on their coats, cloaks, caps, and hats,
and, after kissing Lillie and Miss Florence,
who was going to live there, they all went
home.</p>

<p>And that was the end of Miss Florence's
party. I mean the party that was
given in her honor. If you should like to
see her, just come to me, and I will whisper
in your ear were she lives now; for they
have moved away from Clinton Place.
She and Lillie have become great friends,
and have never been separated since that
celebrated evening, at the party, when the
children tried on all her dresses.</p>

<p>Oh! I forgot one thing. The white
wigs, you know. Well, the boys picked
them up to examine them; and, what do you
think the queer old things were made of?
Why, nothing but a sheet of white wadding.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 233px;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="233" height="350" alt="Portrait of Miss Florence." title="" />
<span class="caption">Portrait of Miss Florence.</span>
</div>
<p>How they did laugh! and how surprised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
they were! for they looked so respectable!
just like the bushy horse hair
wigs you see hanging in Mr. Isabeau the
hair dresser's windows; and I, for one, the
very next time I go to a fancy party,
mean to make a wig of white wadding,
for three cents, for that was all Henry's and
Mary's cost.</p>

<p>Won't Lillie be surprised when she
sees this story in print! I'm quite certain
she will laugh and kiss me, and say, Why,
Aunt Fanny! <i>You</i> were not at the party;
how <i>did</i> you hear? Then I shall look
very mischievous and say, "Ah! that's
telling!"</p>



<p>But there's one thing I must tell,
though I am very nearly certain you have
guessed it already. Miss Florence was
the very doll Lillie's mother had bought
in the summer time, and Helen, the kind
sister, had made every one of the beautiful
things in the little trunk. To show you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
how handsome they all were, I have had
Miss Florence's portrait taken in an everyday
dress, and begged the printer to put
it in this book. Don't it make a flourish?
And was not Helen a perfect darling of a
sister? Don't you wish she was yours?
I do.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"There! what do you think of that
story?" said the little mother, as she rolled
up the manuscript.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is the best of all! They are
all the best stories!" cried the children.
"How we wish we knew Lillie and her
beautiful doll!"</p>

<p>They gathered round their mother,
and admired her picture, which Aunt
Fanny had sent with the MS.; and counted
the flounces, and thought her feet were
"such darlings!" and then exclaimed
again, "Oh, I wish we knew her!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you rather know Harry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the little old gentleman in the wig?"
asked a voice at the door.</p>

<p>The children turned quickly round,
and saw Aunt Fanny standing at the door
laughing at them.</p>

<p>They fell upon her with screams of
delight, and, without meaning to, immediately
upset her upon the carpet; for she
is a little woman, with not a grain of
bodily strength; all her strength is in her
heart. So there she sat, so weak from
laughing, that she could not help herself;
while the children cried, "Oh, Aunt Fanny,
we beg your pardon! did we hurt
you? we only meant to love you."</p>

<p>Then they all got hold of her, and began
to pull her up different ways; in consequence
of which, down she came again,
and half a dozen of the children with her.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, "if you don't stop,
you will push me through the carpet and
floor, and make me fall plump on top of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the cook's head in the kitchen. Come,
let's all sit here, while I tell you something,
and recover my breath."</p>

<p>This invitation suited them exactly.
Down they all dropped, with Aunt Fanny
in the middle. The little ones tumbled
over themselves, and lighted on their heads
at first; but after a good deal of laughing
and nestling up close together, they were
tolerably quiet.</p>

<p>"Well," said Aunt Fanny, "I always
knew you were perfect monkeys for cutting
capers; but I did not know till now,
that you were also a family of crabs."</p>

<p>"Crabs!" cried the children laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes, pulling me up, and trying to make
me walk two ways at once, like a crab:
very good fun for a crab, but it brought me
flat, as you see, and has nearly frightened
out of my head a fine story I have heard,
about the consequences of an odd speech
your friend Harry, the little old gentleman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in the story of Lillie, made to a poor
little boy."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, do tell it!" they cried; "try
to get it back in your head again; we want
to hear it so much."</p>

<p>"Well, will you get up and sit in
chairs, and work like beavers at your mittens,
if I do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! yes!" They sprang up, and
in a surprisingly short time the crochet
needles were glancing in the gas light;
while the mittens grew wonderfully.</p>

<p>It was a new pleasure to hear a story
directly from her lips, especially as she
had brought two or three pictures to illustrate
it, which added greatly to their enjoyment.</p>

<p>It was rather late to begin one, but
the little mother for once consented to let
the small ones of the family sit up; and
Aunt Fanny began the wonderful story of</p>

<div class='center'>
<span class="smcap">The Fairy Benevolence</span>.<br />
</div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE FAIRY BENEVOLENCE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> never was a more loving son
than little Mark. He was only seven
years old. Yet already he was of great
use to his mother, who was a very poor
widow, as poor as could be, and she had
to work, without ever resting, from morning
till night, to get food and clothes for
herself and her dear child.</p>

<p>Oh, that terrible stitch, stitch, stitching!
It must never stop; for all she got
for making a whole shirt was ten cents,
and with her utmost efforts she could only
finish two in a day.</p>

<p>At last, what with crying and sitting
up half the nights in the cold to finish her
sewing, the poor widow fell very ill. What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
was to be done? There was no money to
pay a physician, the rent was coming due,
and little Mark was almost crazy with
grief. He sat by his mother's bedside and
bathed her head, and did all he knew how
to do.</p>

<p>They lived in a small hut, far away
from the village, to which the poor
widow had to take her work every week,
from which it was conveyed to the great
city of New York. There the shirts were
sold for so much money, that the man who
got them made for the shamefully small
price of ten cents, rode in his carriage and
lived in splendor. Ah! how I wish this
wicked man, who was starving many a poor
woman in the same way, could have been
made to feel cold, and hunger, and thirst,
till he nearly died. I think, after that he
would begin to have a conscience&mdash;don't
you?</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 361px;">
<img src="images/i006.jpg" width="361" height="500" alt="&quot;Why, what is the matter, little fellow?&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Why, what is the matter, little fellow?&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>One afternoon, while his mother was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in a troubled slumber, little Mark went
and sat down outside the cottage. A kind
farmer had been felling trees, and one of
these he had given to Mark's mother,
promising to send one of the farm lads
that evening to saw and split it for her.
Mark sat down on the log and leaned
sadly upon his hand, and every little while
he wiped away a tear that rolled down his
cheek.</p>

<p>Presently a tall, handsome boy walked
past. It was Harry, the one who personated
the little old gentleman in the true
story of "The Party Lillie gave to Miss
Florence." His father had a country seat
in the neighborhood, and Harry often took
long walks in search of adventures.</p>

<p>"Why, what is the matter, little fellow?"
he asked.</p>

<p>Mark raised his tearful eyes, and seeing
a kind face, told his pitiful story.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be down-hearted," cried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Harry. "Why, don't you know the fairies
are not all dead yet? Now, there's the
fairy Benevolence; just you ask her, good
and loud, to help you, and see if she won't
do it;" and he patted the little boy encouragingly
on the head, slipped a quarter of a
dollar&mdash;all the money he had with him&mdash;in
his hand, and walked quickly away.</p>

<p>Harry's father was a skilful physician,
with one of the largest and most loving
hearts I ever knew; and when Harry told
Mark to call upon the fairy for assistance,
his idea was that the fairy this time would
come in the shape of a rather stout gentleman,
with the pleasantest smile and
finest set of snow-white teeth that ever
were seen. He had a kind, delicate way
of doing a service, which made it better to
take, and did more good than all the medicine
in Mr. Hegeman's apothecary shop.</p>

<p>Very soon little Mark got up and went
into the cottage. His mother was still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
sleeping. It was now sunset, and the
shadows began to deepen and darken in
the room. Mark sat down by the bedside,
and commenced thinking of what Harry
had told him. He was a little bit of a
fellow, you know, and of course would believe
what such a great boy would say.
So he concluded it must be true that the
fairies were still to be found; and at last
his longing grew so intense that he cried
aloud, "Oh, Fairy Benevolence! come
quickly, and make my poor mother well."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A sweet strain of music seemed to float
in the air; the poor, whitewashed wall of
the cottage opened in the middle, through
which a beautiful lady entered, with a
wreath of flowers round her head, and a
wand of ivory in her hand.</p>

<p>"Well, my little friend," said she in a
soft voice, "what do you want of me?"</p>

<p>Mark was almost speechless with astonishment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and admiration; but he managed
to say, "Oh, lady, if you are the
fairy Benevolence, save my poor mother."</p>

<p>"It is not in my power, my good child.
You must do it yourself. You can, if you
have the courage to go where I tell you,
and hunt for a certain plant. It grows on
the top of a mountain, and is called 'The
Plant of Life.' The juice of that plant
will cure your mother the moment she
tastes of it."</p>

<p>"I will go this instant," he cried; "but
who will take care of my mother?"</p>

<p>"Trust her to me, my dear boy, while
you are absent. She shall have everything
she wants."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you," said Mark; "now
I will go."</p>

<p>"But you must have great courage and
perseverance: there is nothing of importance
ever gained in this world without
them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I have lots of courage!&mdash;only
tell me where I shall find the plant."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;when you get to the top of
the mountain, you must call the doctor
who has charge of the plant; tell him
that I sent you, and he will give you a
sprig."</p>

<p>Mark thanked the kind fairy, and
kissed her hand; he then leaned over
and softly kissed his mother, and then departed.</p>

<p>He walked quickly, but found the
mountain further off than he expected.
He had hardly got a third of the way
when he saw a crow caught in a trap.</p>

<p>"Oh, poor crow!" exclaimed the kind
little fellow, and he pressed down the
spring and released him. The crow flew
off with a "caw, caw," and then spoke like
a human being, saying, "Thank you; I will
repay you."</p>

<p>Mark was surprised to hear a bird talk;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
but he hurried on, and soon after he saw
a rooster chased by a fox. Mark caught
the rooster up in his arms, and concealed
him under his coat; and the fox, staring,
surprised, in every direction, ran off disappointed.
As soon as he was out of sight
Mark let the rooster go, who turned and
said, with a grateful and very long crow,
"Thank you, Mark; I will repay you."</p>

<p>"Why, they can all talk!" exclaimed
Mark; "they must be fairy people, turned
into birds!"</p>

<p>He walked on a long way, and jumped
quickly on one side as he came up to a
great ugly bullfrog, who, charmed by a
snake, was too terrified to move. The
snake was just about to swallow it whole,
when Mark seized a large stone and threw
it with all his strength into the reptile's
wide-open mouth. Down went the stone
into his throat, and choked him directly.</p>

<p>The frog hopped joyfully into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
ditch at the side of the road, croaking
out, "Thank you, Mark; I will repay
you!"</p>

<p>"I declare the frog said the same
thing," said Mark; "it is very strange!
But no doubt they are all fairies."</p>

<p>By this time he had arrived at the foot
of the mountain; but, alas! between it
and him flowed a deep river, and so broad
you could scarcely see the other side.</p>

<p>"Oh dear," cried Mark, "what shall I
do? I can't walk on water, and there is
neither boat or bridge." He sat down on
the bank, covered his face with his hands,
and cried aloud, "Oh, Fairy Benevolence,
come and help me! Why did you tell me
about the wonderful plant which would
save my dear mother's life, when you
knew very well I could never get to the
mountain!"</p>

<p>At this instant, the rooster he had
saved from the fox appeared, and said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
"Listen to me, Mark; the fairy Benevolence
cannot help you here. This mountain
is beyond her dominions. But you
have saved my life, and I am not ungrateful:
get on my back, and I promise you,
on the faith of an honorable rooster, I will
carry you to the other side of the river."</p>

<p>Little Mark was overjoyed to hear this.
He gave a spring, and was in a moment
astride of his comical steed, holding on by
two feathers. The rooster carried him as
smoothly and easily as a steamboat; but
not quite so fast, for it took twenty-one
days' paddling to accomplish the journey;
but at last he was landed high and dry on
the opposite bank of the river.</p>

<p>Mark now travelled for a long time,
but the mountain seemed to recede; and
when at last he arrived at its foot, and
began to climb, he thought it was growing
up in the air, like Jack's beanstalk.
He journeyed twenty-one days up and up,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
but did not get the least bit discouraged:
his great love for his mother gave him
both patience and perseverance. "If I
have to walk for twenty-one years," he
said aloud, "I will never stop till I get to
the top."</p>

<p>"Twenty-one years," echoed a malicious,
sneering voice. "You are a very
conceited little chap! Pray, what do you
want?" and out came, from a cave in the
mountain, a little man with one eye in
the middle of his face, and two noses side
by side.</p>

<p>"I wish to find the plant of life, sir,"
answered Mark, with a bow.</p>

<p>"Oh, you do! Pray, whom for?"</p>

<p>"For my dear mother, who is lying
very ill at home."</p>

<p>"Oh, well you look like a tolerably
good boy, and I believe I will permit you
to go, under certain conditions. I am a
<i>g&eacute;nie;</i> so, you see, I could cook and eat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
you, if I liked. You must reap all my
wheat, thrash out the grains, grind them
into flour, and knead the flour into loaves,
and bake them. You will find all the
tools you want in the cave. When all is
done, you can call me; but till you have
finished, you shall not stir a step." So
saying, he disappeared in a streak of blue
smoke.</p>

<p>Mark had listened in terror, and, when
the <i>g&eacute;nie</i> was out of sight, he looked all
round him. On every side were immense
fields of wheat. He raised his arms, then
dropped them in despair, and, covering his
face with his hands, cried out, "Oh, fairy
Benevolence, come and help me!"</p>

<p>"Go to work, Mark," said a soft voice
close to his ear.</p>

<p>Mark, upon this, took up a scythe and
began to cut the wheat. This took five
times twenty-one days; four times twenty-one
days were spent in thrashing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
grain; three times twenty-one days in
grinding it into flour; and twice twenty-one
days in making it into loaves, and
baking them.</p>

<p>As fast as the loaves were taken out of
the oven, they arranged themselves in even
rows, like books on the shelves.</p>

<p>When all was done, Mark called the
<i>g&eacute;nie</i>, saying, "Here they are, sir, smoking
hot."</p>

<p>The little man appeared immediately,
and counted them&mdash;five hundred thousand
loaves. He tasted a bit from the first
and last loaf, smacked his lips, and said
they were "prime." Then he took a snuff
box from his pocket, and said to Mark,
"Here, take this, and when you return
home, you will find it filled with a new
kind of snuff."</p>

<p>Mark thanked the <i>g&eacute;nie</i>, who immediately
disappeared in a streak of brown
smoke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>He went on climbing the mountain,
but had not got far, when he came suddenly
upon a giant sitting at the mouth
of a cave. He seemed a jolly, good-natured
old fellow, with a pipe, and a bundle of
cigars, and a bag of money on a sort of
table before him.</p>

<p>Mark was not very much afraid of
him, and, making a low bow, said, "Please,
sir, tell me if I am near the place where
the plant of life grows."</p>

<p>"It is not very far off, youngster; but
you don't stir a step farther, until you
gather all my grapes, and make wine of
them. So be in a hurry."</p>

<p>Poor little Mark! He looked round
and saw grape vines, with the fruit weighing
them down in every direction. It took
three times twenty-one days to gather
them, and twice the same time to make
the wine and put it into casks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>When all was done, he called out, "It's
all done, Mr. Giant."</p>

<p>The giant tasted the wine, from the
first and last cask, smacked his lips, and
said, "That's what I call good! Here,
monkey, take this thistle; when you reach
home you will find in it everything you
wish." In an instant, giant, casks, and
all had disappeared.</p>

<p>But little Mark, holding fast to his
thistle, journeyed on. Soon he came to a
wide ravine. It was impossible to jump
across, and so deep that the bottom could
not be seen. He walked along the edge
for a long time, but it grew wider and
more precipitous. "Oh!" cried Mark in
despair, "no sooner do I overcome one
obstacle, than another rises in its place.
How shall I ever get past this dreadful
ravine? He covered his face with his
hands, and murmured, "Oh, fairy Benevolence,
must my mother die!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly was the last word spoken,
when a wolf appeared, and asked in a
rough voice what he wanted in his domains.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Wolf," said Mark trembling,
"I seek the plant of life for my mother."</p>

<p>"Well," growled the wolf, "you must
first kill all the game in my forests, and
make them into game pies. Here are a
bow and arrows, and here is a fire in this
hole; not a step shall you stir till you
have finished."</p>

<p>Mark took the bow and arrows, and
tried to shoot the birds, but he could not
hit a single one. Just then the crow appeared,
and, with a polite "caw, caw," said,
"You have saved my life: now I will
show you my gratitude." So saying, she
killed all the game for him. It took four
times twenty-one days, and he killed five
hundred thousand, of all sorts and sizes,
woodcocks, partridges, quails, chip birds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
robins, and cat birds, for a wolf likes all
varieties. As fast as the crow killed,
Mark cooked, and when it was all done,
he called out, "Mr. Wolf, here are your
pies with plenty of pepper and salt."</p>

<p>The wolf tasted the first and last,
smacked his lips, and exclaimed, "My!
how nice!" He then gave Mark a stick,
saying, "When you have found the plant
of life, and want to go home, get astride of
this stick; but now get on my back."</p>

<p>Mark obeyed, somewhat frightened,
and holding fast to his steed's ears; the
wolf went to the edge of the ravine, gave
a prodigious jump; and, lo and behold!
Mark was safely over.</p>

<p>And now, at last, the high wall of the
garden appeared, in which grew the plant
of life. In the distance was a tall tower,
from the window of which a pretty little
girl was watching him.</p>

<p>Mark uttered a thankful exclamation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
but alas! before he could get inside the
garden, there was a deep moat to cross.
He walked along the edge, hoping to come
to a bridge; but found none. Still the
brave, determined boy was not in the
least discouraged, but said aloud, "I won't
stir from this place until I find some way
of getting across."</p>

<p>Hardly had he uttered these words
before he saw an enormous cat, who, giving
a loud "mew," by way of clearing her
voice, asked him what he wanted there.</p>

<p>Mark repeated his story, and the cat,
with another mew, said, "You cannot go
across without you catch all the fish in the
moat, and fry them with parsley and catsup.
You will find a fishing rod and bait
on the sand. Come! begin! while I set
the table."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said little Mark, "how can I
catch all these fish! Oh, fairy Benevolence!
come to me."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 260px;">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" width="260" height="250" alt="The Cat shot up in the air." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Cat shot up in the air.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will help you," said a sweet voice.
He turned, and there stood beside him the
very little girl he saw looking out of the
window in the tower. How she got there
nobody knows; and what Mr. Nobody
knows he never tells; but the dear little
maiden said, "I am called 'Little Goody.'
The old cat shall have the fish, and you
shall have the plant of life; but she shan't
stay here to tease you."</p>

<p>So she clapped her hands and cried,
scat!! so suddenly, that the cat, catching
up the table cloth, shot up in the air like
a sky rocket, screaming like forty steam
whistles.</p>

<p>Then Goody stamped her little foot on
the ground, and up started a bull frog,
who said right away, "How do you do,
Mr. Mark? I don't forget that you have
saved my life, and I am not an ungrateful
frog. I will catch the fish for you."</p>

<p>It took three times twenty-one days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to catch all the fish, and twice twenty-one
days to cook them. Then Mark called the
cat, saying, "Come, Mrs. Cat, come and
look at your dinner." Down came the cat,
with the table cloth still on her shoulders,
tasted the first and last fish, smacked her
lips, flourished her whiskers and tail, and
cried, "Catipal! How many kinds you
have caught! I must make a catalogue of
them;" and then, to Mark's great amazement,
she took the carving knife and cut
off one of her paws, and handed it to him,
saying, "Take this cat's paw: when you
feel ill, weary, or are growing old, touch
this paw to the end of your nose with the
claws spread out, and all illness and weariness
will disappear over your left shoulder."</p>

<p>Mark took it, and thanked the cat
heartily. He thought he would try it
then, and sure enough, he felt the fatigue
walking over his left shoulder, just as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
had been told. The little girl stood looking
on with an amiable expression, and
then the cat said, "Get on my tail."</p>

<p>Mark did not like to step on the cat's
tail. He knew by experience that a cat
is apt to claw anybody well who ventures
on such a caper; but the little
Goody laughed out, and stepping on it
herself, invited Mark to her side.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, the boy got on; and
then the tail began to grow, till the top
of it reached the garden gate, to which it
fastened <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'itelf'">itself</ins>; and Mark and his pretty
companion walked merrily over this new-fashioned
bridge.</p>

<p>At the entrance, Goody took an affectionate
leave of him, first pointing to a
little clump of bushes with emerald green
leaves, saying, "Never mind asking my
father, the doctor. There is the plant of
life, Mark; pluck it quickly, and off for
home and your mother."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, what joy he felt! He gathered
several sprigs of the precious talisman,
mounted the stick which the wolf had
given him, and presto! in an instant
was at the door of his mother's cottage.</p>

<p>Quickly he entered, and running up to
her, pressed the plant to her lips. She
brightened up immediately, hugged him
to her heart, and exclaimed, "Oh, how
rejoiced I am to have you again! You
have been gone two years, seven months,
and twenty-one days! How you have
grown, and how rejoiced I am, my darling!
my own boy!"</p>

<p>At this moment, the wall of the room
opened, and the beautiful fairy Benevolence
entered. She related to the happy
mother all Mark's adventures, and the
courage, patience, and goodness which he
had shown. Then she told the brave boy
that he might make use of the presents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
given to him by the little old man and
the giant.</p>

<p>Mark opened the snuff box, and out
sprang a number of workmen about the
size of bees, who set to work with such
good will and diligence, that in an hour
they had built a pretty little house, and
furnished it completely, not forgetting a
book case filled with excellent books, some
fine engravings, and a few paintings on
the walls. Mark was especially delighted
at this, for he wanted of all things to learn
to read and write; and the pictures
charmed him even more, for he had a natural
taste for such things.</p>

<p>Then he opened the thistle. Dear me!
It was crammed full of clothes for himself
and his mother, with sheets, tablecloths,
and napkins, all of fine linen. Was there
ever anything known like it!</p>

<p>While they were admiring these wonders,
the busy-bee-men, who had popped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
out of the snuff box, had prepared an excellent
dinner of roast beef and pumpkin
pie; and while Mark and his mother were
eating it, what should march past the
pretty bay window, which opened to the
floor, but two fine cows, one fine horse, a
great rooster, and twenty hens; turkeys,
geese, and ducks; all lowing and neighing,
and crowing, and cackling, and gobbling,
and hissing, and quacking, enough
to take your head off; but Mark and his
mother and the fairy seemed to like it, for
they clapped their hands and laughed so
loud that&mdash;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Why, Mark!" cried a cheery, laughing
voice, "do you mean to sleep a week?"</p>

<p>Mark started up wildly and looked
about him. What did it mean? He was
in his own little bed, in his own little
room!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is the fairy Benevolence?"
he said, looking perfectly bewildered.</p>

<p>Harry shouted with laughter. "Why,
Mark, are you cracked? What has made
you sleep so soundly? Father and I came
here last evening, about an hour after dark,
and found you fast asleep, sitting at your
mother's bedside.</p>

<p>"'Poor, tired little chap, he has watched
with his mother, till he is worn out,' said
father; and he took you gently in his
arms and laid you down here. Then he
sat by your mother's bedside some time,
to watch the effect of some famous medicine
he gave her; and when she was in a
pleasant sleep, he and I went home.</p>

<p>"But we came here this morning early,
and found your mother much better, and
you, you little monkey, still as sound as
a top.</p>

<p>"I've been making your mother's room
more comfortable; and Betty, mamma's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
maid, has brought a great basket full of all
sorts of nice things for her. Come and
see her; she looks real bright! she is getting
well already."</p>

<p>Little Mark had listened, with his
senses getting clearer every minute, and
at last he understood, with a sigh of disappointment,
that his wonderful adventures
and the fairy Benevolence <i>were only
a dream</i>. He was almost crying as he
said, "Oh, Mr. Harry, if you knew what
I had been dreaming, you would be sorry
for me. I was so sure it was all true
about the fairy Benevolence."</p>

<p>"So it is," laughed Harry; "only the
fairy has got whiskers. Come along."</p>

<p>Mark suffered Harry to lead him into
the other room; and then, forgetting everything
and everybody, he rushed up to his
mother, and bursting into tears on her
neck, sobbed out, "Oh, mother! if it only
could have been true, you would have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
cured, and we should have been living in
such a nice house! with cows, and hens,
and turkeys, and all&mdash;oh! oh&mdash;!"</p>

<p>His mother was sitting up in the bed,
and Harry's father was mixing a pleasant
drink for her. Mark looked up as Harry
said: "Come, Mark, don't cry so: here is
a fairy who will help you, and your
mother too." When the little boy saw
the genial, kindly smile of the doctor, he
felt comforted; and sitting down on the
side of the bed, he told his wonderful
dream.</p>

<p>It was listened to with the deepest interest;
and when he had finished, the doctor
patted him on the head, and said,
"Never mind, my fine little fellow! if we
can't give you a grand house and a snuff
box full of servants, and a thistle which
drops out of it all the clothes you want, I
think we can cure your mother; and when
she is well, we will find her something better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to do than making shirts at ten cents
apiece; and you shall go to school, and
learn to be a great scholar; and I don't
see the first thing to prevent your having
a good chance to become, one of these
days, the President of the United States.
So hurrah!"</p>

<p>The kind doctor was as good as his
word. The poor widow recovered rapidly
under his excellent care, which did her
<i>heart</i> more good than her body, for it was
both sweet and strange to receive so much
kindness. Good Samaritans are very scarce
nowadays.</p>

<p>When she was well enough to go out,
she found that her rent was paid, a load
of wood was piled away in the wood shed,
half a barrel of flour was in the pantry,
and some nice hams were hanging up.
Plenty of work at good prices soon poured
in. Little Mark was sent to the district
school, for now he had comfortable clothes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and shoes on his poor little feet; and
really, as he told his mother one happy
evening&mdash;"After all, dear mother, I like
my <i>waking</i> fairy Benevolence best&mdash;whiskers
and all!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A few evenings after the last story
had been read, the little mother drew
from her pocket quite a thick roll of
paper, saying: "Here is something from
Aunt Fanny, with a proposal that will
surprise you."</p>

<p>"What <i>can</i> it be?" cried the children
with eagerness.</p>

<p>"She wants you to act a play."</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> act a play! Who ever heard of
such a thing?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she has partly written, partly
translated a little play, and here is her
letter with it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

"<span class="smcap">My Darling Children</span>;<br />


<p>"Don't you wish, you could get on
faster than ever with your mittens? Well,
here, is a plan that came into my head a
few days ago, and I have been arranging
it very industriously.</p>

<p>"You must go right to work to learn
the parts in this little play. I do not approve
of some parts of it, because a deceit
was practised to bring one of the boys to
a sense of his selfish and undutiful conduct.
This was 'doing evil that good
may come,' and was very wrong. If your
mother were to punish you by deceiving
you, you would doubt her ever after; and
for a child to doubt a parent is, I should
think, one of the most miserable feelings
in the world.</p>

<p>"With this very important exception,
the little play is pretty good. And this is
what your mother and I will do: When
you are perfect in your parts, we will have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a private rehearsal. Then we will invite
about fifty of our friends to witness this
elegant entertainment, for which they must
pay <i>one pair of mittens apiece</i> for the brave
soldiers. We will give them one week to
make them, which will be abundance of
time; and I have no doubt but what they
will think it very cheap pay for so much
pleasure."</p></div>

<p>A long pause took place when the letter
was finished; the children were so astonished,
as well as delighted, at the new
work prepared for them.</p>

<p>"Well!" cried Harry at last, "what
<i>would</i> George say, if he knew the monkeys
and crabs would turn actors next?"</p>

<p>"He would think it splendid," answered
Anna. "You know the poor soldiers,
who were made prisoners at that
dreadful Bull Run battle, acted plays in
their prisons, to keep themselves from dying
of home-sickness."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to act," said Willie.</p>

<p>"I want to act," echoed Bennie.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Little Mother, "let
us see how many characters there are."</p>

<p>They all crowded round while she unrolled
the paper. "Here is the mother,
Mrs. Langdon. You must take that, Anna;
and Harry will be Edward, your son."</p>

<p>"If he is the bad boy," said Anna,
laughing, "I'll give him a thrashing every
morning before breakfast."</p>

<p>"That will give you an excellent appetite,"
returned Harry; "for I shall run
away, and you will have to catch me,
first."</p>

<p>"Clara must be Mary Brown, Edward's
nurse."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear little fellow," said Clara,
patting Harry, "old nursey will buy you
a stick of candy."</p>

<p>"Ago-o-o," said Harry, like a little
baby, which set them all laughing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Johnny shall be Mr. Sherwood, the
tutor, because he is naturally such a sober
little fellow," said the mother; "and we
will invite Gus Averill, Harry's friend, to
be Morris, because he and Harry are of
the same age and height, and that will be
excellent. Minnie can do Jane, the
maid, very nicely; and Willie and Bennie
can be Patrick and Andrew, the waiter
and gardener."</p>

<p>So it was all settled; and the next
morning the children began to study their
parts&mdash;the larger ones assisting the little
ones&mdash;so that they learned as quickly as
the best. In the evening they repeated
what they knew to their mother, working
at the same time on their mittens, and
were just as busy and happy as good and
industrious children always are.</p>

<p>It was really surprising how soon they
became perfect, and the rehearsal went off
with complete success. Harry and Anna<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
kept their faces very well; and only Bennie
and Willie grinned a little when they
first came on the stage, which was the back
parlor.</p>

<p>The company were to sit in the front
parlor, and some curtains were hung up
between that and the back room, and
made to draw quickly aside, and drop just
as quickly.</p>

<p>The invitations had been sent out, and
were every one accepted. This is one of
them:</p>

"An Entertainment for the Benefit<br />
OF THE SOLDIERS:<br />
<small>AT THE LITTLE MOTHER'S HOUSE,</small><br />
<i>Christmas Eve, Dec. 24, 1861</i>.<br />
ADMISSION, ONE PAIR OF MITTENS."<br />
</div>

<p>The great evening came; and the children,
ready dressed for their parts, were
in a tremendous flutter. Even the little
wee ones were to do something. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
were stationed at the parlor door with
baskets, and charged not to let a soul
come in, unless the pair of mittens were
paid into one of the baskets. I warrant
you they took very good care of that, for
their eyes were as sharp as needles; and
the moment the door was opened they
would all cry "Mitten money! mitten
money! pay your mitten money!" which
made the company laugh so they could
hardly get the "mitten money" out of
their pockets.</p>

<p>After they had all arrived, and were
comfortably seated, each with a beautifully
written play bill, with the names of the
actors upon it, the entertainment began.</p>

I cannot, I will not stay here another day.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Langdon.</span> But, Mr. Sherwood,
listen a moment!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> No! I have made up my mind!
I am tired of losing my time and pains with
Edward!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Please have a little patience.
Try him once more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> He has already abused my patience
beyond all bounds. He is wilful,
ungrateful, idle, and stupid; and all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
blame will fall on me, whom you have employed
to educate him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Can you believe that I would
blame you, who have been so kind to my
son? Remember, that when my husband
died, you promised me to devote yourself
to my fatherless boy. Will you leave your
work undone? He has talents, a good
heart&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> No, madam; you deceive yourself.
His heart is bad; his character
unamiable; he is proud, vain, selfish,
wicked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> What! wicked!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Yes, madam. Does he not
treat your servants as if they were slaves?
Does not everybody hate him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Oh, how severe you are! My
dear son is young: he has pride, to be sure;
and that very pride once caused you to
say that you would make a great and good
man of him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Yes, I said so; and perhaps I
might have succeeded without you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Without me! Why, what
can you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Do you wish me to be frank
with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Certainly. I shall feel obliged
to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Well; it is you who spoil the
effect of all my lessons. It is you who
spoil Edward. Excuse me, but I must
say it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> I, Mr. Sherwood! I confess
I love him above all other earthly possessions;
but that is surely excusable. He
is the image of a husband taken away from
me in the first year of our marriage. You
remember my grief was so excessive that
I could not nourish my poor child; and
by the advice and entreaties of my relatives
and physician, I consented that he
should be taken into the country by my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
humble, faithful friend, Mary Brown, who
nursed him for eighteen months with her
own child, while I was sent to the West
Indies, and afterward to Europe, to recover
my health. Edward is all I have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.</span> S. If you love him so much, send
him to boarding school.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs.</span> L. Impossible! I cannot part
with him. But I will put him entirely
under your control. Only stay, and you
shall govern him just as you like.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Scene II.</span>&mdash;<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Patrick</span>.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Patrick, where is my son?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patrick.</span> I don't know, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> What? You don't know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patrick.</span> No, ma'am. After taking
his lessons this morning, he made me dress
him three times. Yes, ma'am, three times!
and by way of paying me for my trouble,
he hit me a blow on the side of my head,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and crying, "Take that, old bog-trotter"&mdash;he
ran off laughing; and five minutes after
that, when I was talking with Andrew on
the edge of the hill at the back of the
house, he came suddenly up behind and upset
us both. My back is all but cracked.</p>

<div class='right'>
[<i>Rubs his back.</i><br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> You see how he treats your
servants!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Well! but he did it laughing.
It was only his fun, dear little fellow!
Patrick, go find him, and bring him
here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patrick.</span> And suppose, ma'am, he
won't come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Tell him his <i>mother</i> wants
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Seen who?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patrick.</span> Master Ned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Yes, I have seen him; I see
a great deal too much of him; he has just
chased me out of the garden with a hay
fork.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patrick.</span> Is he there now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Oh yes; he tied an old hen
fast by the leg to the fence, and is shooting
at her with his bow and arrows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> What a boy! how thoughtless!
Patrick, go and get him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span> (<i>twisting his hat about, and
standing first on one leg, then on the other</i>).
Mrs. Langdon&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Well, Andrew, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> I am your gardener, ma'am;
am I not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Yes, Andrew.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> I have always tried to give
you satisfaction?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Certainly. You have been
very faithful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> You have fed me well,
paid me well, and, what is far better, you
are good and kind to me, which I like
more than money, because the one you
owe me, and the other you give me of your
own free will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Well, Andrew&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Well, Mrs. Langdon, I am
going to leave you against my own desire.
You are an excellent mistress, and I don't
want to leave you, but it must be&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Andrew, I am surprised!
Why do you wish to leave me? Have
you anything to complain of? Have I
done you any injustice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Oh no, ma'am! You are
all kindness and goodness; neither proud,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
scolding, nor brutal; <i>but everybody is not
like you</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Do the other servants impose
upon you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Oh dear, no, ma'am! they
are good and honest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> What do you complain of,
then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Why, ma'am, since I have
begun, I will go on. Every man who
respects himself, takes a pride in his work.
If he is a gardener, he likes to hear people
say, "There is a capital garden! Those
vegetable beds are very nicely kept!"
Well, it makes me mad to see your money
and my work all wasted and destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> But how?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> That's just it. I know
how, and you don't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Will you tell me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Well, it's Master Ned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Master Ned?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Yes, ma'am. He is a perfect
little Satan; he keeps me running after
him, till I am out of breath, and perfectly
hoarse with talking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Why! What has he done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> The same he does every
day: ten ground moles, fifteen chickens,
twenty pigs, would do less injury in a
year than he does in one day. He upsets
the planks, tears up the walks, breaks the
windows of the hot beds, tramples on the
flowers, breaks down the pear trees, plays
the mischief in the vegetable garden, and
runs off with my tools. I can't stop him;
and when I say, "Master Ned, you must
not hinder me so in my work; if you want
to turn double somersets, go and do it in
your dear mamma's parlor; go and plague
Mr. Sherwood, or Patrick, or, still better,
torment Jane, and leave me to plant my
cabbages." Do you know how he answers?
By cracking me over the shoulders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
with his switch, and crying out, "Look
out, old potato top, or I'll tumble you into
the pond." I might as well ask the river
to run up hill. And look here, ma'am,
see this picture (<i>shows picture</i>) he drew
of me, watering the garden in a thunder
storm, as if I ever did such a thing! or
looked like that, either!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> In a short time, no one will
be able to live with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Dear me! It is nothing but
his high spirits and love of mischief! But
I own you are not unreasonable, Andrew.
I don't want my son to tease you,
much less ill-treat you. I will forbid him,
before you, from going in the garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Good! Only do that, and
I will give him my finest flowers, and my
best fruits, if he will only keep away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> (<i>sighing</i>). I seem to have
made twenty excuses for my son in ten
minutes; but you shall be satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> Mrs. Langdon, I must also
speak to you about Master Ned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> This morning he opened the
cage door and let your canary fly away,
and twisted poor Poll's neck because she
said, "Bad boy!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Oh! oh! my parrot's neck!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Now, madam, this is not
thoughtlessness: it is a case of actual badness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> Yes, and he does something
as bad every day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Why, he is worse than
Lucifer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> Every morning, ma'am, he
overturns your toilet table, spills the
cologne water, upsets your work box,
makes your finest letter paper into boats,
and puts the kitten to sleep in the crown
of your best bonnet; and then, when I beg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
him to behave, he calls me an old cat, and
a buzzard, and a red-headed crab.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Why have you not told me
this before?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> Why, ma'am, I have; but it has
always ended by his being excused and
I scolded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Stay here. You shall see
if I excuse him! He might change his
clothes ten times, pull up a plant or two,
pick a few flowers, or even trouble you at
your work. I don't see anything so very
dreadful in all that. But to twist my
parrot's neck! Oh!&mdash;</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Scene V.</span>&mdash;<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Patrick</span>.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Well, Patrick&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patrick</span> (<i>rubbing his legs and making
wry faces</i>). He is coming, ma'am&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patrick.</span> Master Ned has been breaking
a stick over my legs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> (<i>very angry</i>). The child's a
demon! I am outrageous! I am furious!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Control yourself, madam! do
not fly so suddenly from extreme indulgence
to severity; do not correct a
child when you are in a passion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> You may be right, sir, but I
shall punish him as he deserves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Please don't beat him,
ma'am. Here he comes.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Scene VI.</span>&mdash;<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Edward</span>, <i>who runs up
to his mother, and is about to kiss her</i>.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Were you asking for me,
mamma? dear, pretty mamma!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Stand back, sir! I don't kiss
a bad boy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> A bad boy! Why, mamma,
what have I done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Do you dare to pretend that
you do not know? Look at Andrew,
Patrick, and Jane!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> I see them. Have they been
complaining of me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Yes, and I am astonished at
what they tell me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> The mean things! Mamma,
they&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Take care, sir! Don't add
lying to your other crimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward</span> (<i>looking angry</i>). But what
do they say I have done? You scamp of
a turnip top, Andrew! is it you who are
trying to rob me of my mother's love?
Such a good boy as I am, too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>. You a good boy! about
as much as the old gray donkey is a robin
redbreast. No! you are a nuisance, and
ought to live up in the air in a balloon
by yourself. You have ruined my garden;
and whenever I beg you to stop, you
answer me with your switch over my legs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward</span>. Oh, mamma, that is too
cruel! I only wish to make you a bouquet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
when Andrew comes up, yelling like
a tiger, "Don't touch those violets! Let
that pansy alone! Stop! you shan't take
a rose!" Well, what can I do? So I
dug up a little plot, pulling out a few
vegetables, so as to raise some flowers for
you myself. Then Andrew screams out,
"What have you done? You have pulled
out all my onions!" Then I take another
place, and old Sourcrout bawls, "The
beets are planted there." I declare it's
too bad! I wish to cultivate the earth,
because Mr. Sherwood says the most respectable
men in the world are farmers;
and Andrew, mad as fury, comes and
drives me away. Suppose I do spoil some
of his stupid cabbages; if I could present
you with a flower raised by my own
hand, it would be worth all his cabbage
heads, and his own too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> The darling! How he loves
me! Andrew, you are a brute!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Thank you, ma'am. That's
what I call justice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> My dear son was only seeking
to gratify me, and you did very
wrong to hinder him. Dear child! he
was willing to work like a farmer to
please me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> I'm dumb! If you wish
it, he may scratch up the whole garden,
and empty it into the duck pond; he
may break down fifty trees a day; he
may have a mass meeting of the dogs, pigs,
chickens, ducks, turkeys, and the old gray
donkey, in the best flower beds; and end
by inviting Farmer Green's bull Sampson
to dance a hornpipe through the glass into
the conservatory. Nothing now will astonish
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> That will do. My son, I forgive
your capers in the garden, but I have
a more serious charge against you. How
can you excuse yourself for letting my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
canary fly away? and above all, why did
you twist my poor Poll's neck?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Well, mamma, you would
have done the same. I did open the door
of the canary's cage. He was poking his
poor little bill through the bars, and I was
so sorry for him! I thought he wanted
to go to his mother, who, perhaps, might
be perched up in the tree opposite, and so
I gave him his liberty. Mr. Sherwood
has often told me that kindness to animals
is one of the finest virtues.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Oh! was twisting my parrot's
neck another proof of your kindness?
What had the poor bird done to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Nothing to me, mamma; but
the wicked little squinting thing had bitten
Jane's finger, when she was kindly
giving him some sugar; and she cried, and
seeing the tears rolling down her cheeks,
I got very angry, quite in a rage. I am
very sorry, but I did not think that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Jane would have been the one to accuse
<i>me</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> There, Jane! you are an ungrateful
creature! You have tried to
poison my mind against my son!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> But, Mrs. Langdon&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Be silent! Your affair is
settled. But, Edward, when Patrick came
to call you, why did you break a stick
over his legs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> It was very wrong in me,
mamma; but I had just gathered some
splendid roses for you: they were on the
ground, and the clumsy fellow trampled
upon them without seeing them. It put me
in such a passion, I did whack him once
or twice. I beg his pardon, mamma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> He should ask yours, you
dear boy! I order you all to apologize
to my son, or I shall discharge you. You
first, Jane. My son would not for twenty
gardens, or poll parrots, do a mean thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
or tell a lie; he shall be respected and
obeyed as I am; and those who don't like
it can leave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span> (<i>ironically</i>). I beg your
pardon, Master Edward, for the good
switching you so kindly gave me; I beg
your pardon for the damage you did to
the garden; you will oblige me by continuing
to tumble everything topsy-turvy,
and break all the rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patrick.</span> Forgive me, Master Edward,
for all the pretty little capers you cut up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Oh, certainly. Mamma,
they are good sort of people, after all; and
I hope you will excuse their coming to
complain of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> To oblige you, my dear son,
I will. You see, all of you, how amiable

<p><span class="smcap">Edward</span> (<i>contemptuously</i>). Like <i>me!</i>
I should think not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Yes, sir! They are not rich,
to be sure, or born of a high family,
nor is it likely that their heads will
ever burst with the knowledge a fine,
thorough education gives; but they are
capable of every good and noble quality
of the heart. Do you understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Yes, Mr. Sherwood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Try to make everybody love
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Dear mamma, I don't care
for any love but yours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> But you must care for the
respect and friendship of others; which, as
Addison says, "improves happiness and
abates misery, by doubling our joys and
dividing our griefs."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward</span> (<i>sneeringly</i>). He talks like
a book, don't he, mamma?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> He does, indeed; and if you
love me, you will profit by his advice and
lessons. Perhaps you owe more to him
than to me. Love him, and be grateful to
him, for his constant endeavor to cultivate
your virtues and talents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Love him&mdash;I cannot promise
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Why not, my son?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sherwood.</span> You are ungrateful,
to vex and grieve a mother who loves you

he pleased and contented?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> He is so, ma'am, as happy as
a king! Daisy&mdash;that's our cow, ma'am&mdash;has
just given us a beautiful calf; we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
fifty chickens, twenty geese, and a good
old pony who carries our vegetables to the
railroad station for the New York market.
I thank God, and you who have been so
good to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Is big Peter industrious, and
does he bring up Morris in the right way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh! thank God again for all

books; he does the most terrible long
sums, almost like a flash of lightning&mdash;his
schoolmaster is astonished at his quickness;
his head is just as full as it can hold
of learning, and his heart is just as full
of love for his father and mother. (<i>She

Come, mother, let us go away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> No doubt Edward is picking
a basket of fruit for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> I rather think not. Mother,
I beg you to let us leave at once. I have
my reasons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> And I can guess them. Edward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
has been beating you&mdash;has he
not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Impossible!!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> Very possible, indeed. In
fact, quite certain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Dear me! did he hurt you
much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> It is not the pain. I could
have beaten him twice as hard if I wanted
to. What hurts me most is what he said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> And, pray, what did he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> Well, ma'am, when I wanted
to hug old Beppo, he told me to take my
paws from the dog's neck; that I was a
country bumpkin, and a big clumsy booby,
and no brother of his; and the sooner I
skedaddled home the better he should be
pleased.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh! the unnatural, wicked
boy! You are right, my son; we will go
home, where we are not despised. Good
bye, Mrs. Langdon; Master Edward is your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
son; but I no longer think of him as the
child I fed at my breast, and loved nearly
as my own. He has struck his brother!
Come, my son, you are not his equal;
therefore you cannot be his friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> But listen one moment, Mary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> No, ma'am; we will not stay
where we have been so humbled; we are
plain country folks, but we have hearts
and feelings, and your son has neither.
God will never bless him. Such pride has
no place in heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> You are right, Mary; but
perhaps Morris offended him. You have
not heard both sides.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> Yes, I offended him. I put
my arms round his neck to hug him, when
he threw me off; and when I said that
that was not the way to treat a brother,
he struck me!&mdash;more than once, too!&mdash;and
said those mean, cruel things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, the little villain!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Are your eyes still blinded,

Will you praise his good heart
when he dares to ill-treat and strike his
nurse's son?</p>

him; his ingratitude and wicked conduct
have nearly broken my heart. What
shall I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> I have just thought of a plan,
madam. It is a desperate remedy; but I
know of nothing else in the wide world
that will cure him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Tell me&mdash;what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>aside</i>). Nurse, send away your

to the stable, and see if old Whitenose has
eaten all he wants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Don't be alarmed, madam. It
is his heart that is to be put to the trial;
reverses and adversity often soften the
heart; when one has suffered, he knows
better how to pity the deprivations and
sufferings of others. Your son has never
been contradicted; he may be unkind and
cruel sometimes from thoughtlessness and
ignorance. Now, let us put his heart to a
severe trial. Let us pretend that he is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Mary's son, and Morris is really your son.
Push the experiment so far as to send him
to live with her, until he is thoroughly
humbled, and his faults disappear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>starting up</i>). Oh, no! no!
Your trial may all be very fine, but I will
not lend myself to it. No, sir. We are
not rich, but we have always been honest,
and I will not have anybody suppose for
a moment that I could have committed
such a dishonorable, such an unnatural
act. Say that Morris is not my son? If
I should join in such a trick, my husband
would hate and despise me, and rightly too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> But, nurse, you forget. It is
only supposing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Suppose as much as you
please, sir; even the suspicion of such a
plot would blacken my name forever.
Oh! would any woman deny her own
child?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Listen to me, Mary. I love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Edward as much as you do Morris. Do
you think I would abandon my child or
disgrace you? Far from despising you,
I shall take care to let everybody know
the sacrifice you are making for my son's
sake; and every one will praise you for
helping me, and believe that love for Edward
has alone induced you to consent to
this plan. If he should grow up to be a
man with such selfish, cruel ways, it will
break my heart. I should be in my grave
before many years, killed by the misconduct
of my only child. I have but one
objection to what we are about to do.
We shall practise a deception.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>weeping</i>). Oh, ma'am, and
my son, my poor little Morris, he too must
be deceived; he cannot be in the secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> I will try to make him
happy. I will treat him like my own

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh yes, ma'am, I know you will
be kind; but suppose in that week, your
fine house, your gay clothes, your grand
dinners and suppers should turn his head,
and ruin his loving heart for his parents.
If he should return to us, despising our
humble life,&mdash;oh! I can't bear it! My
child would be worse than lost to me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Fear nothing, Mary. Morris

have to sleep with one eye open, to keep
you out of mischief; but if you are good
and work hard, though I can't give you
such fine clothes, I will love you as much
as Mrs. Langdon did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward</span> (<i>his lips quivering</i>). Oh!
she is no longer my mother!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Well, am I not as good? I
don't live in such a fine house, crammed
full of gimcracks; but I've got a dictionary
that you can study in, and big Peter,
your father, shall hang a great switch over
the mantelpiece, to remind you that he
won't stand any nonsense, or idleness,
from you. Dear me! how glad he will
be to see you! Come, run with a hop,
skip, and jump, to the stable, and harness
up old Whitenose: it's high time we
were off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward</span> (<i>sighing</i>). Yes, mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But first bid Mr. Sherwood
good-by, and the rest. Thank them all
for their kindness to you; wait here a
moment, till I come back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Well, Edward, or Morris I
should say, you see that nothing is sure
in this world: and I cannot but think
that this reverse will do you good. You
treated every one except your mother&mdash;as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
you supposed Mrs. Langdon was&mdash;with
harshness, insult, and insolence: perhaps
now you will learn, in the very strongest
manner, the exact meaning and intention
of the Golden Rule.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Oh, how unhappy I am!
The very servants are more fortunate!
They at least can live with Mrs. Langdon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> You despised and insulted
your own mother; you struck your
brother; suppose he in return should&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward</span> (<i>weeping</i>). Oh stop, I beg,
Mr. Sherwood!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> You weep because you are
only the son of Mary and big Peter, a
poor country farmer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Oh no, sir! if they are my
father and mother, I will try to respect
them, but to leave Mrs. Langdon&mdash;to be
no longer her son&mdash;that is what is driving
me to despair. Oh, I shall die! I
shall die!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Do not be so distressed. Mrs.
Langdon will still be very kind to you.
She will love you still.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> If she will only think of
me sometimes. Will you speak, sir, of
me to her, after I am gone? Will you
tell her that my greatest grief, is leaving
her; that I shall never, never, never forget
her? Will you do this, dear Mr. Sherwood?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>with agitation</i>). Yes, my dear
boy, I will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> And will you forgive me
for having profited so little by your lessons;
and being so often disrespectful?
Please forgive me, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Willingly, my child. This is
a great change of fortune. An hour ago,
you were rich and well born, now you are
the son of a poor farmer. Try to do your
part well in this altered sphere; be gentle
and good, and God will not desert you.
Good-by.</p>

it true then, that Master Edward is not
Mrs. Langdon's son?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> Yes, indeed! Just look at the
poor boy; we are so sorry for him! and
though he has teazed us a great deal, we
feel for him with all our hearts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Just so with me. He has
put me in a rage no end of times, and
when I was scolded before you all, this
morning, I was as mad as a wasp with the
toothache. But since I have heard of his
great misfortune, I am sure, I would not
bear him malice for the world; so I have
come to make friends with him, before he
goes away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Dear Andrew! (<i>He weeps
again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Here! I have brought you
a basket and some tools; they will be
useful to you in your new situation; and
here is my silver watch, it goes splendidly!
but you must not wear it every day,
you must save it for Sundays. I give it
to you, that you may remember me, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
say, "My friend Andrew gave me this
watch, because he loved me."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> How kind you are to me,
who have deserved it so little! Pray forgive
me, and forget my bad conduct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> I forgive you with all my
heart! and now that you are in trouble,
I remember nothing. I will come to see
you next Sunday evening, and bring you
some nice little present. Keep up a stout
heart, and a stiff upper lip; you are not
used to work, and at first it will come very
hard; ploughing is not quite so easy as
playing cat's cradle, and backgammon
in the parlor. You will have no dancing,
unless a mad bull gallops after you, when,
no doubt, you will practise double quickstep
to perfection. All the gay pleasures
you have now, will be lost to you; but
there is one happiness, worth all the rest,
which you can keep if you please; and
<i>that is a clear conscience</i>. Serve God, love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
your parents, and work faithfully, and you
will be sure to possess this great blessing,
and consequently be happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Thank you, Andrew, for

me when I am gone?</p>

sometimes to speak kindly of me to Mrs.
Langdon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> We promise.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward</span> (<i>who has turned away and

always to wear. I am Morris, son of Mary
and big Peter! Oh, I can bear that; but
to leave Mrs. Langdon&mdash;to be no longer
her son&mdash;to have no right to her love&mdash;oh!
oh! I shall die!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> Good morning, brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward</span> (<i>without turning round</i>). Good
morning, Master Edward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> You seem angry with me;
but you are wrong. If I have injured
you, it is not my fault. <i>I</i> did not do it
of my own will; and yet I have come to
beg your pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> It is not your fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> But&mdash;don't you love me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Why do you ask, sir?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> I call you "<i>brother</i>," and you
call me "<i>sir</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward</span> (<i>with effort</i>). Well, if you
wish it, I will call you <i>brother</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> And love me like one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> Well, now, I'm going to try
you. Here, do you see these things? I
found them in your pockets. This gold
watch, this pocket book full of money, this
yellow pin, with a little ball in the middle
of it, which looks like glass&mdash;I really
thought it was glass, and the pin copper,
but they say it is a diamond set in gold,
and worth more than all the rest. Then
I asked Mrs. Langdon if she had given me
all these grand things to do just as I
pleased with. She said, "Certainly"&mdash;and
I have come as fast as ever I could with
them to you!&mdash;take them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Thank you. I'd rather you
kept them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> Do you refuse your brother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> What could I do with such
finery&mdash;they do not suit my humble station?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> But it is not for yourself
that I give them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> I don't understand you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> They are for your poor
mother; for your father who works so
hard, and is so patient and good. To
scrape together money enough to pay his
rent troubles him dreadfully; and so the
very first time the landlord comes, give
him all these gimcracks, on condition that
he leaves him alone for the rest of the year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Yes, I will do this; give
them to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> Here they are. Will you
promise me one thing more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> It is that you will love your
father and mother dearly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Yes, Morris; I will try.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> And tell them every day
that I shall never forget them; and when
I am a man, and you are too, you shall all
come and live with me, and you and I
will have everything together, just like
two brothers&mdash;will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Yes, brother&mdash;(<i>Morris clasps
him in his arms, and says</i>)&mdash;"Oh, how

to have kept you for some days; but Mary
says she must take you with her. Be a

I shall never forget you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Well&mdash;what is it, Andrew?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Well, ma'am, it is that you
will keep this poor little fellow, Morris,
with you, and give us leave to treat him
the same as Master Edward; and as we
do not want any one to lose by this, we
offer to have a third of our wages taken
off, which you will please give to Mary
and big Peter every month, to make up to
them for the loss of their son's services.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> Oh, my kind, generous
friends! never will I forget this proof of
your love!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> But only this morning you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
all three made terrible complaints about
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> But we don't bear malice,
and he is so unhappy! We have forgotten
all he did to annoy us. Please, ma'am,
to keep him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> No, Andrew; you have
taught me what is <i>my</i> duty. I belong to
my father and mother, and I am ashamed
that in my misery I forgot it. The poorer
they are, the less I ought to leave them.
Good-by, all my friends: love and protect

<h2>THE LITTLE PLAY MITTENS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> play was finished amidst a tremendous
clapping of hands, and the curtain
fell.</p>

<p>Then the company began to talk just
as fast as they could. They were astonished
at seeing the play so well acted, and
laughed over and over again when they
recalled the comical little gardener and
waiter, who wore such funny dresses, and
knew their parts so perfectly, and acted
with such serious faces. Minnie came in,
too, for her share of praise,&mdash;indeed, every
one was excellent; and when the children
made their appearance a few minutes afterward&mdash;still
dressed as they were in the
play&mdash;they were received with more clapping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of hands, and this time with plenty
of kisses too.</p>

<p>After that, some ice cream and cake
were handed round; and then the company
went home perfectly delighted, resolving
in their own minds to get up something
themselves in behalf of the soldiers.
So certain is it, that one good action will
prompt another.</p>

<p>The Little Mother hastily counted over
the nice warm mittens with their thumbs
and fingers sticking out in every direction,
while the children looked on with breathless
interest.</p>

<p>"Fifty-seven pairs," said the Little
Mother.</p>

<p>"Fifty-seven pairs!" echoed the children,
with a shout that made the windows
rattle. "Oh, goody! goody! goody! how
glad we are!" and they danced round the
pile which lay on the floor in perfect
ecstasies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"How glad brother George will be!"
said Willie.</p>

<p>"Oh, if he could only have been here
to-night," said Clara, and her loving eyes
filled with tears.</p>

<p>The Little Mother's lip trembled. She
knew that her soldier boy, sooner or later,
must know what a battle was; and a prayer
rose in her heart that a Protecting Power
would guard him from harm, and return
him safe to her loving arms.</p>

<p>The children kissed her softly, and
tenderly, and went quietly off to bed,
almost forgetting that Santa Claus was to
come that very night, and fill their stockings.
But <i>he</i> did not forget; for when
the bright morning sun of the clear, cold
Christmas day, peeped in at the nursery
windows, he certainly must have thought
that Santa Claus had considered these
children as pinks and patterns of perfection;
for there were no less than three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
new dolls; a grocery store for them to
shop at; two elegant workboxes with
"Anna" engraved on the lid of one, and
"Clara" on the other; a beautiful writing
desk, filled with nice pens, ink, and paper,
for Johnny; a mahogany tool chest, completely
filled, for Harry; an entire set of
Cousin Alice's excellent and interesting
books, for Bennie and Willie; a most
charming little book, called "Our Little
Girls," for Lillie; and two others by the
same author, who is a minister's daughter,
as good as she is lovely, for Minnie.
These were called "A Little Leaven," and
"Two Little Heaps;" and, let me tell you,
Minnie considers them the best books that
ever were written; while little Fanny's
favorite was, and is, the "R. R. B's." It
is the history of a dear little Robin Redbreast
and his family; and Fanny says it
is a "darling book."</p>

<p>The dear absent soldier brother was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
not forgotten. On the table were two
packages directed to him. One of these
contained a dozen fine hem-stitched pocket
handkerchiefs, with the initials of his
name beautifully worked in a corner of
each. This had been done by Anna, who
was very skilful in such dainty arts. The
other package consisted of a complete set
of Dickens's works, in strong, plain, but
very neat bindings.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Harry. "George will
stand on his head for joy, when he gets
these; he will be so tickled! The very
books he was longing to own!"</p>

<p>"How <i>can</i> he stand on his head?"
asked Bennie.</p>

<p>"This way," answered Harry, and
going up to the side of the room, he
suddenly lifted his feet in the air, resting
them against the wall, and stared at Bennie
with his face upside down, and the top of
his head on the carpet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The children laughed heartily, and as
a matter of course, all the little brothers
began to practise standing on their heads,
till they nearly got fits of apoplexy, with
the blood rushing the wrong way.</p>

<p>After they had returned from church
that morning, every one of them wrote to
George a company letter, wishing him a
merry Christmas, telling him all the wonderful
news about the little play; and informing
him of the quantity of mittens which
were coming. They had now finished
eighteen pairs, to add to their fifty-seven,
which their friends had given them.
These seventy-five pairs, were to be sent
away the next morning; but George's
presents were to be carefully kept until
his happy return home; for he could not
put all those precious books in his knapsack;
and as he might move from one
place to another very often, the less he
had to carry in marching, the better.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The smaller children felt an almost reverential
affection for their soldier brother,
who had gone away to fight for his
country. They regarded his letters as
perfect wonders, with Camp Ellsworth
printed on the outside of them, and such
superb capital D's and G's inside. The
little ones did not know <i>how</i> he could
make such splendid letters, sitting in a
tent, with the paper on his knee, ready
to drop it at a moment's warning, and
flash fire and shot out of his gun, at the
enemy. They were quite sure he would be
a General in a very short time, and Johnny
had serious thoughts of writing to the
good President Lincoln, and asking him
to make George one without waiting any
longer. Indeed, he <i>did</i> write: but his
mother thought it best not to send it:
though I was sure the President would
have liked it very much; for he is such
a great-hearted, good man, such a pure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
patriot; and I happen to know that he
loves children dearly. Here is Johnny's
letter. It is a simple, funny little epistle,
full of trust and faith.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">President Lincoln</span>:</p>

<p>"<i>My Dear Friend</i>,&mdash;Do you know
my big brother George? He is such a
good boy! He never teazes us, or the
cat, or anybody. Mary O'Reilly (that's
our kitten) always rubs her coat against
his legs when he comes home; so you see
that is a sign that he is never cruel to
animals. He once tried to teach a crab
at Long Branch to dance the polka, but
he didn't hurt it; no, indeed!</p>

<p>"Please, my dear friend, to make him a
General, with a long sword, saddle,
bridle, and a whack fol de rol; though
I don't know what that is&mdash;I heard a
soldier singing it&mdash;and I will come and
hug and kiss you as hard as a rock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Clara and Anna say, they will hug
and kiss you too, if you will make George a
General; only you must promise not to
scratch their faces with your beard, as
papa sometimes does&mdash;just for fun, you
know. Besides which, my dear friend,
they will give you a mitten apiece. How
would you like that? They make lots
for the soldiers, out of skeins of long
yarn; mamma says you are a famous fellow
for spinning splendid yarns yourself.
Ours is dark blue; but mamma says,
yours are all the colors of the rainbow,
and a great deal of black besides; and
everybody is delighted with them, and
all the soldiers love you, and I am your</p>

<span style="margin-right: 3em;">"affectionate friend,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Johnny.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>I should not be in the least surprised,
if the good President should answer this
letter after he sees it here; and send his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
answer to Mr. Appleton for Johnny. If he
does, I will tell you all about it, as sure
as my name is Aunt Fanny. Meanwhile,
you must know that the fifty-seven "little
play mittens," as the children called them,
and the eighteen pairs, which they had
made this time, and which they called
their "two story mittens," have gone to
the brave soldiers. Do tell me, my little
darlings, how many have been sent altogether;
now that we have come to the</p>
